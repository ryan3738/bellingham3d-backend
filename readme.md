# Full Stack Next.JS E-Commerce App

ðŸ‘‹ This is an eCommerce backend implementation for Bellingham 3D using KeystoneJS.

## Description
### KeystoneJS

The backend uses KeystoneJS which is a node & Typescript based GraphQL server-side client that uses Next.js for the admin UI. Keystone generates basic GraphQL resolvers generated using Prisma. More advanced resolvers are in the mutations folder. The resolvers then fetch the data from a PostgreSQL database and expose a GraphQL api endpoint. The admin UI can be used as a cms for performing CRUD operations on database items.

### Integration with Stripe API for Customer Checkout

In the Stripe implementation: To ensure a secure checkout, the final checkout mutation is handled on the server. On the server prices are recalculated with product information from the database to ensure correct pricing is charged. The cart is then converted to an order and saved to the database. Finally, an order is returned to the client with details on their purchase.

## Tech used:

- KeystoneJS
- Typescript
- Prisma
- GraphQL
- PostgreSQL
- Supabase
- Digital Ocean
